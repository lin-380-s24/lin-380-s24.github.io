<section id="prerequisites" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>This course takes a pedagogical approach which assumes no prior experience with statistics or programming, making it an accessible resource for novices beginning their exploration of quantitative text analysis methods. However, it is recommended that students have some familiarity with linguistics and/or language science research and research methods.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="approach" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="approach">Approach</h2>
<section id="building-community" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-community">Building community</h3>
<p>Building a community of learners is at the heart of enriching courses. It is key to keep in mind that each one of us is intrinsically motivated to know more about the world –that’s why we are all here! The experience of learning, however solitary it may seem at times, is best achieved in collaboration with others on their educational journey. Each of us brings important and valuable life experiences and academic knowledge and interests that are vital elements to making our class exceptional. Don’t check yourself at the classroom door! Engage, reflect, share, and discuss. Take risks, ask questions, and let’s embark on this intellectual journey together.</p>
</section>
<section id="transparency-and-responsibility" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transparency-and-responsibility">Transparency and responsibility</h3>
<p>In my view, any course is not an island to itself. In an educational journey, a course provides you opportunities to grow both in learning content and the meta-process of learning how to learn. I will approach this course in precisely this way: I am more concerned with process than product. In this course (and in all courses) the material will prove challenging at times. This is a good thing. You will learn a lot, but you likely will not “learn it all” –I’m still learning! Learning is as much about success as it is trial and error. I will highly value trial as it provides an opportunity to err and learn. As part of this process, I will ask you to reflect on your process –when you seek support and how you find it. Your responsibility is to own your learning, collaborate with peers, seek and discover, and contribute to the learning of your peers (as well as mine). My responsibility is to provide the scaffolding and guidance to get you started on (or rather, continue) your journey.</p>
</section>
<section id="diversity-inclusion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="diversity-inclusion">Diversity &amp; inclusion</h3>
<p>I am committed to developing and supporting an ongoing environment that serves students from all diverse backgrounds and where diversity is viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit to our learning community. It is my goal to present materials and provide options for activities that are respectful to gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. Despite my best efforts, there may still be ways to improve the effectiveness of this course for you personally or for other students or student groups. Your suggestions for improvement are encouraged and appreciated.</p>
</section>
<section id="flexibility" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="flexibility">Flexibility</h3>
<p>I start this semester by acknowledging the social, political, and medical challenges that all of us face. I recognize that some of you are more impacted than others and that many of you may be learning from a place of anxiety, uncertainty, and trauma. I will stay cognizant of this throughout the semester, especially as I make teaching decisions. If there are ways I can make your learning experience better, please let me know.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="learning-program" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learning-program">Learning program</h2>
<p>The course is grouped into five learning modules: (1) Orientation, (2) Foundations, (3) Preparation, (4) Analysis, and (5) Communication. The goal of each module is to build your conceptual knowledge and practical programming skills towards developing an original text analysis project prospectus/ final project which will showcase your knowledge and skills with a tangible, shareable, and reproducible research product.</p>
<p>The opening of each module will be signaled by the seedling icon (🌱). Each module targets a set of essential questions. Each of these modules in turn is composed of a series of daily activities that will guide us through topics that will help us address each of these essential questions. Days signaled by a water drop icon (💧) will include learning materials and group and individual activities to build our skills and knowledge on a particular conceptual topic. Days signaled by a branch icon (🌿) will include learning materials geared towards the practical application of conceptual knowledge through programming demonstrations and lab activities. Days signaled by a tree icon (🌳) are dedicated to project development activities.</p>
</section>
<section id="assessment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
<p>In line with my view that learning is a process, not a product, individual learning activities will be assessed through qualitative feedback, peer review, and self-assessment –but will not be assigned a grade by the instructor. Instead, you will be asked to provide a self-assessment of your learning progress periodically during the semester and a final process letter at the end of classes. As a final grade is an institutional requirement, during the final examination period I will meet with students individually to critically assess their learning progress (including self-assessments and a process letter) and determine an appropriate final course grade.</p>
<section id="module-based-components" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="module-based-components">Module-based components</h3>
<p><strong>Engagement discussions</strong></p>
<p>These discussions will ask you to reflect on your preliminary reactions to the learning materials (<a href="https://qtalr.github.io/book">textbook</a> and <a href="https://qtalr.github.io/qtalrkit/">recipes</a>) and collaborate with your peers to establish, clarify, and discover new connections.</p>
<p><strong>Expansion activities</strong></p>
<p>These will be a series of <a href="https://github.com/qtalr/lessons">interactive coding</a> (‘swirl’) and <a href="https://github.com/lin-380-s24?q=lab-&amp;type=fork&amp;language=&amp;sort=name">lab activities</a> that aim to employ your conceptual knowledge and develop your R programming skills.</p>
</section>
