The goal is to introduce the course and the instructor, and to provide an overview of the course goals, approach, and resources.\n\nI want to showcase some of the things that students will be able to do by the end of the semester. I also want to introduce the course website and the resources that we will be using throughout the semester.\n\nSome of the things that I want to showcase are:\n\n- Data literacy: This means that students will be able to identify, interpret, and evaluate data analysis procedures and results. I want to show a collage of visuals, tables, websites.\n- Research skills: This means that students will be able to design, implement, and communicate quantitative research. I want to show a collage of visuals, tables, websites.\n- Reproducible workflows: This means that students will be able to apply programmatic strategies to develop and collaborate on reproducible research projects. I want to show a collage of visuals, tables, websites.\n\nMaybe consider some studies of some interest having to do with language, text analysis, corpus linguistics, natural language processing:\n\n- ...\n\n\n-->\n",
