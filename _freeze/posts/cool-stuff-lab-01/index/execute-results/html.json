But you should know that Quarto can also be used with other languages, such as Python, Julia, and Observable JavaScript. This is a great feature, as it allows you to use the best tool for the job, and to combine different languages in the same document!\n\n:::{#lst-r}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- c(1, 2, 3)\ny <- c(4, 5, 6)\n\nx %*% y\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     [,1]\n[1,]   32\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nR code\n:::\n\n:::{#lst-python}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.array([1, 2, 3])\ny = np.array([4, 5, 6])\n\nnp.dot(x, y)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n32\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nPython code\n:::\n\nAt the moment you have enough on your hands with Quarto + R. But it's good to know that you can expand your horizons in the future!\n\n## Adding figures\n\nI know a lot of you are really excited to get to the point where you can add figures to your documents. We cover figures head on soon!\n\nFor now, I want to introduce you to the `ggplot2` package, which is a great tool for creating figures in R. In @fig-brown-lob I don't expect you to understand this code, but if you are interested and have some time, you can take a look at the code and see if you can understand what it does.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n````{.cell-code}\n```{{r}}\n#| label: fig-brown-lob\n#| fig-cap: \"Passive voice in the Brown (AmE) and LOB (BrE) corpora\"\n\n# Load packages\nlibrary(ggplot2)      # for plotting\nlibrary(dplyr)        # for data manipulation\nlibrary(corpora)      # for the BrownLOBPassives dataset\n\n# Get the dataset\ndata <- BrownLOBPassives |> as_tibble()\n\n# Create boxplot\ndata |>\n  ggplot(aes(\n    x = genre,\n    y = passive,\n    color = lang\n    )) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(\n       x = \"Genre\",\n       y = \"Passive voice (count)\",\n       color = \"Language\"\n       ) +\n    coord_flip()\n```\n````\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Passive voice in the Brown (AmE) and LOB (BrE) corpora](index_files/figure-html/fig-brown-lob-1.png){#fig-brown-lob width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
