# Framing Research

## Connect

- Research area\
*general area of interest where a researcher wants to derive insight and make a contribution to understanding*
- Research problem\
*highlights a particular topic of debate or uncertainty in existing knowledge which is worthy of study*

## Research area

Consider areas along:

- Discipline
- Language(s)
- Methodology
- Application

:::{.notes}
Examples:

- Discipline: Sociolinguistics
- Languages(s): English, Spanish
- Methodology: Corpus linguistics
- Application: Language policy

*frames the type of inquiry to be conducted:\
explore, predict, or explain?*
- Research question\
*clearly defined statement which identifies an aspect of uncertainty and the particular relationships that this uncertainty concerns*

| French L2 learners will make more vocabulary errors in oral production than in written production. | ? |
| Can the association strength between Mandarin words and their English translations predict translation difficulty for novice translators? | ? |
| How common are gender-specific words in German-speaking communities on distinct online forums, and how does it reflect gender roles? | ? |

**Organization**

- Clear separation between input, process, and output
- Single purpose files, input and output independent

**Reproducibility**

- `DESCRIPTION` to provide metadata
- `Makefile` to automate the process
- `README` to guide the user

**Compatibility**

- Platform agnostic files

<!--

Activity ideas:

1. Brainstorm Research Topics: This activity helps students start thinking about potential areas of interest for their research. Encourage them to consider current events, personal interests, or gaps in existing research.
2. Operationalizing Exercise: By operationalizing a concept, students learn to convert abstract ideas into measurable variables. This is a critical skill in quantitative research and helps in formulating clear, researchable questions.
3. Technique Matching: This game-like activity encourages students to think about which text analysis techniques best fit different types of research questions. It can be done with flashcards or as a digital quiz.
4. Drafting Research Questions: This activity consolidates the day's learning by having students apply their knowledge to draft their own research questions. Offering immediate feedback, either from peers or the instructor, can be highly beneficial.
