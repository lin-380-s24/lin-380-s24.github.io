## Orientation

Communication is the way to contribute. It is the way to share your work with others, to get feedback, and to build on the work of others. The reproducibility of studies and the ability to follow up on the work of others is key for innovation in science and engineering.

# Public-facing

## Presentations: Tips

- Balance the information
  - Moving forward feels good
- Reduce text, increase visuals
- Include slide numbers/ total number of slides

## Presentation: Structure

- [Quarto website](https://qtalr.github.io/resources/recipes/recipe-11/#lst-quarto-website)
  - Multiple format rendering
- [Presentations](https://qtalr.github.io/resources/recipes/recipe-11/#fig-revealjs-example) with `revealjs` as the format
  - Interactive slides
  - Easy to navigate
  - Presentation tools
  - etc.

## Presentation: Set up

We need to adjust our `project_web` repositories to reflect some additional features in the [upstream repository](https://github.com/lin-380-s24/project_web).

1. Sync fork on GitHub
2. Pull changes to local repository (RStudio)
3. Remove `.github/` directory (with the workflow)
4. Learn the `quarto render` and `quarto publish gh-pages` commands
