# Approach

-

# Resource setup

## Install software

- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) -- Windows users should also install [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)

## Create accounts

- [GitHub](https://education.github.com/pack/join) Education
- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/signup)

## Getting started: R + RStudio

One time:

1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Search for the `qtalr/lin380` image
3. Run the image (with password)
4. Open the container in web browser
5. Log in to RStudio Server (with password)

To start working:

1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Start the container
3. Open the container in web browser
4. Log in to RStudio Server (with password)

## Getting started: Git + GitHub

One time:
