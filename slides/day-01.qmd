# Resource setup

## Getting started: Docker

We will use Docker to manage the computing environment for this course. This will pre-load all the software we need to work with.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
1. Install and open Docker Desktop
2. Pull the `francojc/lin-380` image
3. Start the container

## Using Docker

From now on you will:

:::: {.columns}

## Getting started: Hypothes.is

We will use Hypothes.is to annotate course readings. This is a flexible and powerful tool that will allow us to share and discuss our thoughts on the readings in a collaborative way.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
1. Create a [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/start/) account
2. Join the course group [lin-380-s24](https://hypothes.is/groups/4Zk3YJv3/lin-380-s24)
3. Access the annotation layer on the readings (*e.g* [textbook](https://qtalr.github.io/book/))
