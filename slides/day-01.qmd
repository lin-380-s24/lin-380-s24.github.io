# Resource setup

## Getting started: Docker

1. Install Docker Desktop
2. Open Docker Desktop
3. Pull the `francojc/lin-380` image

## Using Docker

From now on you will:

1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Start the container
3. Open the container in web browser
4. Log in to RStudio Server (with password)

::: {.aside}

## Getting started: Hypothes.is

We will use Hypothes.is to annotate course readings. This is a flexible and powerful tool that will allow us to share and discuss our thoughts on the readings in a collaborative way.

1. Create a [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/start/) account
2. Join the course group [lin-380-s24](https://hypothes.is/groups/4Zk3YJv3/lin-380-s24)
3. Access the annotation layer on the readings (*e.g* [textbook](https://qtalr.github.io/book/))
