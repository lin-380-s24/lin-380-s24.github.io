# Science

## Why science?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%" .incremental}
Humans are inherently limited in their ability to understand the world as it is. In what ways?

- Our individual experiences are limited and not representative of the whole.
- Our cognition is not free from bias. Memory and recall are not perfect.

## What is science?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
A process for understanding the world as it is.

**Text analysis** the process of extracting information from observed language data.

It can be used as a tool for research or a method of inquiry in its own right.

## Cases{.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
@Bychkovska2017 investigates possible differences between L1-English and L1-Chinese undergraduate students' use of lexical bundles, multiword sequences which are extended collocations (*i.e.* as the result of), in argumentative essays. The authors used the Michigan Corpus of Upper-Level Student Papers (MICUSP) corpus using the argumentative essay section for L1-English and the Corpus of Ohio Learner and Teacher English (COLTE) for the L1-Chinese English essays. They found that L1-Chinese writers used more than 2 times as many bundle types than L1-English peers which they attribute to L1-Chinese writers attempt to avoid uncommon expressions and/or due to their lack of register awareness (conversation has more bundles than writing, generally).

L2 writing. Are there differences between L1 and L2 writers in the use of lexical bundles in argumentative essays? MICUSP (L1 English) and COLTE (L1 Chinese) corpora. 2x as many bundle types in L1 Chinese English.

## Cases{.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
@Olohan2008 investigate the extent to which translated texts differ from native texts. In particular the author explores the notion of explicitation in translated texts (the tendency to make information in the source text explicit in the target translation). The study makes use of the Translational English Corpus (TEC) for translation samples and comparable sections of the British National Corpus (BNC) for the native samples. The results suggest that there is a tendency for syntactic explicitation in the translational corpus (TEC) which is assumed to be a subconscious process employed unwittingly by translators.

**Next time:**\
We will discuss [Recipe 1 "Academic writing with Quarto"](https://qtalr.github.io/qtalrkit/articles/recipe-1.html) and work on [Lab 01](https://github.com/qtalr/lab-01)"\
**Remember:**\
Do readings and use Hypothes.is to socially annotate the readings. This helps us generate discussion that we can pick up in class.
