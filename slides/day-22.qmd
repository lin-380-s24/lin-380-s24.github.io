# Statistical inference

## Paradigm

**Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST)**

- $H_0$ **Null hypothesis**: no effect\
*assumed true from the outset*
- $H_1$ **Alternative hypothesis**: effect exists\
*only if we have evidence to reject the null hypothesis*

**Evidence**: the likelihood of the observed statistic(s) if the null hypothesis is true is below some pre-specified threshold (significance level).

## Approaches {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Theory-based NHST**

- Classical
- Based on theoretical distributions
  - Requires assumptions about the data (*ex.* parametric, non-parametric)
- Relies on conceptual understanding of mathematical properties
  - Tends to be more difficult to understand (for non-statisticians)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Simulation-based NHST**

- Empirical
- Based on resampling methods
  - Does not require assumptions about the data
- Frames the problem in terms of the data
  - Easier to understand (for non-statisticians)
:::

The `infer` [@R-infer] package is a simulation-based approach to NHST.

## Workflow with `infer` {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**A. Identify**

- Map the hypothesis to the response and explanatory variable(s)
- Determine the information types and relationship(s) between the variables.
- Choose the relevant test statistic and significance level

**B. Inspect**

- Summarize and visualize the relationship(s) between the variables
- Check assumptions (if necessary)
- Choose resampling method (bootstrap, permutation, *etc*.)

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**C. Interrogate**

- Generate the null distribution
  - Specify the relationship(s)
- Calculate the observed test statistic
- Calculate the p-value
- Generate the resampling distribution of the test statistic
- Calculate the confidence interval

**D. Interpret**

- Evaluate p-value and confidence interval
- Evaluate evidence in the context of the research question

## Case study

**Research question**: TBD


## Identify

- Define the research question
- Identify the population of interest
- Define the parameter of interest
- Define the null and alternative hypotheses
- Choose the significance level
- Choose the test statistic

## Inspect

- Collect the data
- Summarize the data
- Visualize the data
- Check the assumptions (not necessary for simulation-based NHST)
- Choose the resampling method

## Interrogate

- Generate the null distribution
- Calculate the observed test statistic
- Calculate the p-value
- Generate a resampling distribution of the test statistic
- Calculate the confidence interval

## Interpret

- Evaluate the p-value
- Evaluate the confidence interval
- Make a decision in the context of the research question

# Wrap-up

## Final thoughts

- Inferential data analysis is a powerful tool for making inferences about a population based on a sample.
- The `infer` package provides a simulation-based approach to NHST that is easier to understand than classical methods.
